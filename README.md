Victorian coding challenge: Wikipedia based data extraction and poem generation

#### Disclaimers
The poem generated by this script does not represent our views or opinions. The AI output may not be factual and should not be assumed as such. The AI can have unexpected behaviour and may not match the rest of the poem.

The AI generated poem (second paragraph) may not rhyme due to the generalised dataset that the AI was trained on. Retraining an AI on rhyming poems is infeasible due to the size of a dataset of rhyming poems needed and the compute power required to retrain.


The algorithm may sometimes error out with a json.decoder.JSONDecodeError error via the Datamuse API. If it does, please try rerunning the script and/or resetting the runtime.

## To run the script in google colab:
1. Go to the top bar --> Runtime --> Change runtime type --> Hardware accelerator --> GPU --> Save

4. Run second code block to run the main script

## Out of memory errors
If an out of memory (OOM) error is returned, please factory reset runtime (Top bar --> Runtime --> Factory reset runtime) until you get a GPU with more than 8gb of ram.

The current GPU can be checked by running the code block containing the command !nvidia-smi (Located at the bottom of the notebook).

## Thanks
Thanks to OpenAI for the GPT-2 AI and thanks to github user timschott for making a fork of GPT-2 that is compatible with newer versions of Tensorflow.

The original GPT-2 AI is available at: https://github.com/openai/gpt-2

And timschott's fork is available at: https://github.com/timschott/gpt-2

Thanks to Google Colab for the use of their GPU's for the testing and deployment of the GPT-2 model
