Victorian coding challenge: Wikipedia based data extraction and poem generation

The poem generated by this script does not represent our views or opinions. The AI output may not be factual and should not be assumed as such. The AI can have unexpected behaviour and may not match the rest of the poem.

## To run the script in google colab:
1. Go to the top bar --> Runtime --> Change runtime type --> Hardware accelerator --> GPU --> Save
2. Press Connect (top right)
3. Press the small run button on the left of the first block to install dependencies, code and model  
4. Run second code block to run the main script

## Out of memory errors
If an out of memory (OOM) error is returned, please factory reset runtime (Top bar --> Runtime --> Factory reset runtime) until you get a GPU with more than 8gb of ram. The current GPU can be checked by running the code block containing the command !nvidia-smi (Located at the bottom of the notebook).

## Contact details
Please email Xavier Cohen at COH0002@brunswick.vic.edu.au or Sandro Mortimer at MOR0034@brunswick.vic.edu.au if you have any difficulties or questions.

## Thanks
Thanks to OpenAI for the GPT-2 AI and thanks to github user timschott for making a fork of GPT-2 that is compatible with newer versions of Tensorflow.

The original GPT-2 AI is available at: https://github.com/openai/gpt-2

And timschott's fork is available at: https://github.com/timschott/gpt-2

Thanks to Google Colab for the use of their GPU's for the testing and deployment of the GPT-2 model
